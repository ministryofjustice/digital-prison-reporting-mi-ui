# Instructions

This is an HMPPS project that has been created as part of bootstrapping - 
see https://github.com/ministryofjustice/dps-project-bootstrap.

This bootstrap is community managed by the mojdt `#typescript` slack channel. 
Please raise any questions or queries there. Contributions welcome!

Our security policy is located [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-digital-prison-reporting-mi-ui/security/policy). 

More information about the template project including features can be found [here](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NDSS/pages/3488677932/Typescript+template+project).

## Running the app
The easiest way to run the app is to use docker compose to create the service and all dependencies. 

`docker-compose pull`

`docker-compose up`

### Dependencies
The app requires: 
* hmpps-auth - for authentication
* redis - session store and token caching

### Running the app for development

To start the main services excluding the example typescript template app: 

`docker-compose up --scale=app=0`

Install dependencies using `npm install`, ensuring you are using `node v18.x` and `npm v9.x`

Note: Using `nvm` (or [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)), run `nvm install --latest-npm` within the repository folder to use the correct version of node, and the latest version of npm. This matches the `engines` config in `package.json` and the CircleCI build config.

And then, to build the assets and start the app with nodemon:

`npm run start:dev`

### Run with local redis

Install Redis
`brew install redis`

Run the Redis Server
`redis-server`

Download the postgres driver (for the API) and put in the project root: https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/postgresql-42.6.0.jar

And then, to build the assets and start the app with nodemon:

`npm run start:dev`

If you want to use the dev HMPPS Auth instead of the local one, you can add the following env vars (e.g. in your IntelliJ run config):

```shell
HMPPS_AUTH_URL=https://sign-in-dev.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/auth
API_CLIENT_ID=<Your client ID>
API_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your client secret>
SYSTEM_CLIENT_ID=<Your client ID>
SYSTEM_CLIENT_SECRET=<Your client secret>
```

### Run linter

`npm run lint`

### Run tests

`npm run test`

### Running integration tests

For local running, start a test db, redis, and wiremock instance by:

`docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yml up`

Then run the server in test mode by:

`npm run start-feature` (or `npm run start-feature:dev` to run with nodemon)

And then either, run tests in headless mode with:

`npm run int-test`
 
Or run tests with the cypress UI:

`npm run int-test-ui`

### Dependency Checks

The template project has implemented some scheduled checks to ensure that key dependencies are kept up to date.
If these are not desired in the cloned project, remove references to `check_outdated` job from `.circleci/config.yml`

## Deployment to Cloud Platform Environment

The app is deployed to the namespace: `hmpps-digital-prison-reporting-mi-<env>`.

Config for the dev environment can be found here: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/tree/main/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/hmpps-digital-prison-reporting-mi-dev

The CPE deployment for this app consists of: 
- A service account for CircleCI. 
- An Elasticache cluster.
  - A secret containing the EC details (used by this app).
- A secret containing the session secret for this app - generated by Terraform.

Additionally, the HMPPS auth service details need to be manually deployed to each environment. The file `hmps-auth-secret.yaml` should be updated with the base64 encoded values and applied to the environment.

_NB: Please do not commit these changes to `hmps-auth-secret.yaml`._

Example of base64 encoding a secret value:

```
echo -n 'placeholder' | base64
```

Example of applying the secret to an environment:

```
kubectl -n hmpps-digital-prison-reporting-mi-dev apply -f hmps-auth-secret.yaml
```

## Running acceptance tests

Acceptance tests can be run using the following commands:

```shell
npm run acceptance-test
```

They can be configured using the following environment variables:

```shell
CYPRESS_USERNAME=# The HMPPS Auth user's username, for the relevant environment (e.g. SPEGG_GEN)
CYPRESS_PASSWORD=# The HMPPS Auth user's password, for the relevant environment (e.g. Password1!)
CYPRESS_BASE_URL=# The URL of the UI to test (defaults to 'https://digital-prison-reporting-mi-ui-dev.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk/')
CYPRESS_SIGN_IN_URL=# The URL of the HMPPS Auth server (defaults to 'sign-in-dev.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk')
CYPRESS_API_BASE_URL=# The base URL of the environment's API (defaults to 'https://digital-prison-reporting-mi-dev.hmpps.service.justice.gov.uk')
```
